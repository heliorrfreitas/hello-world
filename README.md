# hello-world

Hello! 

I am Helio Rui Ramos Freitas
I work with Java. In the place I work we use the Struts framework. I also have tried and looked up how to make games with libGDX, but I still haven't released any game or app. I have made some apps in an android class I had at my college, but since they were simple I also decided not to publish. I am looking forward changing this and publishing my code here on Github, and put some apps in the real world. Even if anyone looks at it. It will be a good learning. Hope I can kick ass and build some awesome stuff.

See you!
